# Developer Test Assignment

## The Application

A basic todo application where the user can manage their upcoming tasks.

### Frontend functionality
* User can create todos (should have creation and due date)
* User can update todos (description, due date, done/not done)
* User can delete todos

### API functionality
The API will have more functionality than the frontend. Feel free to include the filtering in the UI, but it is not required.
* CRUD operations for todos supporting the frontend
* Endpoint to fetch a list of todos according to a filter. When multiple filters are specified then results must match all
  * Done / Not done
  * Due date
  * Text search which matches any part of a todo description

## Technology

### Stack
* Frontend with JavaScript library/framework
* Backend API (.NET preferred / Java)
* Persistent database (SQL / NoSQL up to developer)

## Additional notes
Backend architecture should not be a single layer - nor should it be way more complex than a small application needs.
